## Exercise

Today we're going to use the built-in `mtcars` dataset to practice regression. Note this is a built-in dataset provided as part of the `datasets` package in `R`.


### Background

Run `?(mtcars)` in the console (do NOT add it to this `Rmd` file) and briefly read the help page. Specifically, take note of the following:

1. What is the source of this data?
2. What is this dataset measuring? (i.e. what is the response variable?)
3. What predictors are available and what do they mean?

You may want to also run `head(mtcars, 10)` or `View(mtcars)` to inspect the data frame briefly before moving on.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
# He just looked at all possible predictors and then picked the ones with the lowest pvalues.
lm.mtcars = lm(mpg ~., data = mtcars)
summary(lm.mtcars)
```
### Fitting

Uncomment the line below and finish it. Specifically, use `lm` to run a regression of `mpg` on a few predictors in the data frame (choose a few that you think would make a good model). Make sure to include `data = mtcars` as an argument to tell R what data frame to use.

```{r}
lm.mtcars = lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec + am + hp , data = mtcars)
```

View a summary of the regression by uncommenting and running the line below

```{r}
summary(lm.mtcars)
```

Briefly inspect the residuals plot by running `plot(lm.mtcars,ask=F,which=1:2)` . What do you observe, and what does it mean?

### Interpretation

Uncomment the line below to get the estimated coefficients along with their standard errors, and statistics testing whether they're zero.

```{r}
summary(lm.mtcars)$coefficients
```

Give an interpretation of the estimate and standard error for one of your predictors. Be careful in your wording of the interpretation.

> An increase of 1000 lbs of weight is associated with a 3.2 mile per gallon decrease (on average) holding (all other variables constant) 1/4 mile time, transmission type, and horsepower constant. The standard error is the standard deviations of the coefficient

What does the intercept here mean? (Except for special situations, we generally don't care much about the intercept, but you should still understand what it means.)

> Intercept is the average miles per gallon when weight = 0, 1/4 mile time = 0, transmission type is automatic, and horsepower is zero

Which coefficients are significant? How do you know?

> Weight and om are sigificant because they have a pvalue of <0.5

What is the Residual Standard Error (RSE) for this model? How many degrees of freedom does it have?

> _REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE_

```{r}
n = length(mtcars$mpg)
p = 5

# RSE
sqrt (sum (resid(lm.mtcars) ^2) / (n - p))


#degrees of freedom
n-p
```

What is the R² for this model? (Hint: look at the output of `summary`) Give an interpretation of this value.

> _REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE_

Briefly read about the [adjusted R² here](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/adjusted-r2/). What is the adjusted R² of this model and how does this differ from the normal R² value? (Hint: again, look at the output of `summary`).

> _REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE_
Suggested to always look at the Adjusted R squared when comparing lm models

Generate $95\%$ confidence intervals for the coefficients using the `confint` function. Give an interpretation of these confidence intervals.

```{r}
confint(lm.mtcars)
```

> Something like: given 1000 new datasets of cars (of cars similar to mtcars) we expect 95% of these will have coefficients that fall within the given intervals. 


## Complex terms

Look carefully at the available predictors in the data frame. Using a combination of interaction plots, data plots, and test fits, can you improve the model by finding either an interaction OR a non-linear term that is **appropriate** and **significant**?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
pairs( mtcars %>% select(mpg, wt, qsec, am, hp))

```

correlation between predictors?
hp and wt look pretty correlated, lets drop hp

non-linearities?
wt looks more quadratic than linear, lets include quadratic term

```{r}
lm.new = lm(mpg ~ wt + I(wt^2) + qsec + am, data=mtcars)
summary(lm.new)
```

Repeat the steps above for this new term. Give interpretations of the estimate, error, significance, and find a confidence interval for the new parameter. How have the R² and adjusted R² changed?

Do you think you can improve your model any further? Feel free to try some more models if you want. What model in the end seemed like the best fit for the data?
